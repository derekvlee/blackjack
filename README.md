# blackjack

Designed and developed by Derek Lee.
All the code within this project is my own unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Purpose:
To design and develop a simulation of the card game - BlackJack. 

### Motivation:
I was interested in how the playing strategy could be designed and developed as the game itself involves a number of different states and  rules.  An additional motivating factor was to demonstrate my Java coding skills using design patterns, generics, rest, TDD with Mockito and Junit.

### Status:
The project is a work in progress.
