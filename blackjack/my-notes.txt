Next: 
- add a GameFactory (AbstractFactory) and pass to GameMediator.
- GameMediatorTest: implement tests,
DONE - Fix bug: cutting card given on initial deal
DONE (ltd.)- need functionality to assert the hands cardValue
- add header comments to each class
- consider creating a professional document on the project, it would contain UML diagrams and notes on obstacles and progress.


Next - further:
- Associate Player(s) with each Hand
- Associate a bank roll to finance each Player
- Implement the strategy 


Future:
- Machine Learning - let the machine learn how to play BJ. it must come up with it's own strategy. how does this differ from basic strategy?
- Card counting - could be a special observer, recording the card count for the game. It's algorithm needs to be de-coupled from the Implementation.
- Simulation - large scale
- How could I incorporate web-services into this project?
- Design and Create a web based front end.
- Add persistence using Hibernate.
- Add threading.
